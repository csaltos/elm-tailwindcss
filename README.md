Elm with Tailwind CSS
=====================

## What ?

A simple start project with an Elm using Tailwind CSS styles with purge included.

## Why ?

Because Tailwind CSS is nice and when use it with Elm is a lot of power and beauty.

## How ?

Ensure you have recent versions of Yarn and Elm installed and then run:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

If that works you may open your favorite browser to http://localhost:5000/ and
make changes to your code live.

If you want to export a final optimited version of your code you may run `yarn build`.

Please take a look to:

* `package.json`
* `postcss.config.js`
* `tailwind.config.js`
* `public/assets/pcss/styles.pcss`
* `src/Main.elm`

**NOTE:** Of course you can use NPM instead of Yarn, in that case you may change the
watch scripts from `package.json` from `yarn` calls to `npm` calls.
